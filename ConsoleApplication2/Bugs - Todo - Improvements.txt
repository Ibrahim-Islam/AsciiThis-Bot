--Bugs--
* put all comment id's in a text file or something similar. Putting them in a list means that everytime an 
instance is created, the list is reset.
--Improvements--

--ToDo--
* Have a separate method that checks to see if the bot is already logged in. This will save relogging in all the time
* Document some of that redditsharp code, it's pretty vague at times
